# OK, what's this?

"Deploy your deployment while you deploy"

> Deployer is a generic tool to automate deployments

# How is this useful?

This allows you to install **Windows on ARM** into esoteric devices like the Lumia 950 phones or SOCs like Raspberry Pi.

Although Deployer 3 has been reimagined and redesigned to handle almost every kind of deployment you might think of.

# **Super easy to use. No-hassle.**

Please keep reading carefully. All you need is here.

- One of the supported devices

- [MCCI](https://mcci.com/) for their great contribution to the RaspberryPI WOA project:
  - for porting their **TrueTask USB stack** to Windows 10 ARM64, and allowing non-commercial use with this project ([see license](Docs/mcci_license.md))
  - for funding the site of the project http://pi64.win and the discourse site http://discourse.pi64.win
  - Special thanks to Terry Moore for all the great support and commitment, and for setting up the online presence for the project and its infrastructure.
